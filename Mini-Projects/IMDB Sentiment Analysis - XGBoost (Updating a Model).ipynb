    "In this notebook we will consider a situation in which a model that we constructed is no longer working as we intended. In particular, we will look at the XGBoost sentiment analysis model that we constructed earlier. In this case, however, we have some new data that our model doesn't seem to perform very well on. As a result, we will re-train our model and update an existing endpoint so that it uses our new model.\n",

Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `# TODO: ...` comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

       "'Somewhere, buried very deep inside this film is a half-way decent movie trying to get out. The only traces are a few early scenes in Los Angeles (in a bar and a graveyard) and thereafter a couple of pieces of production design. Like I say, buried very deep. One of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react believably in unbelievable situations. Annie Mcenroe\\'s reaction to being told that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace from the first movie) is (was?) a werewolf is, if I recall, along the lines of; \"Oh! Really?\". Not one of the better responses to said challenge. The non sequitirs continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirba the (apparently self-appointed) \"Queen of the Werewolves\". As Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie. Yes, even better than the werewolf group-sex scene, Reb Brown\\'s acting, and the oddly simian-looking werewolf suits. The end credits have assumed minor legend status and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why and remember, the whole film makes about the same amount of sense. If you happen to catch this on US television the credits have been re-edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot of Danning ripping off her top with another endlessly repeated shot of her ripping open a cloak only this time she has some kind of top on underneath. It\\'s a sort of absurdity, cherry-on-top moment which defies satire.'"

That is, we don't necessarily need to use our model's results immediately and instead we can peform inference on a large number of samples.
